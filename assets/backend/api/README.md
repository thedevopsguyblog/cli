# AppSync API + Backend Lambdas

This folder is where we keep the appsync resolvers, lambda functions executed by cognito and other services and the actual API "contract" `schema.graphql`.

`build.mjs` is the "glue", at build time, the .ts files are compiled into .js and executed by the runtimes (appsync JS resolvers/nodejs lambdas).

## Local Development

1. Auth with AWS
2. "npm run codegen" to generate api schema

>*There is a dependency order for BE and FE development.*
Work in the following order.

3. Update IAC `./lib/*.ts` and deploy.
4. Update API `schema.graphql` & API resolvers `./api/src/resolvers/*.ts`, then deploy.
5. In ./frontend run `npm run codegen`, begin working on frontend code
